  description:
    "The MOVE Framework (Master the Moment, Options Generation, Validate Choices, Execute and Evaluate) transforms how leaders navigate uncertainty. This practical journey equips you with field-tested tools—from RACI matrices and pre-mortems to remote team charters and energy budgeting—to make confident, data-informed decisions under pressure. No theory, just actionable practices for SMEs, NGOs, and LGUs facing real-world complexity.",
